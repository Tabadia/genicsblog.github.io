JavaScript forms the foundation of almost everything you see on the web. So, with web development on the rise in 2022 and it being the base of thousands of popular frameworks, it's a good one to learn.

## Basics

1Ô∏è‚É£ Include JS code in a HTML page

```html
<script type="text/javascript">

//JS code here

</script>
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Call an external JS file

```html
<script src="thematrix.js">
</script> 
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Include comments

```js
// Single line comment //
```

```js
/*
Multi line comment
*/
```

## Data types

1Ô∏è‚É£ Numbers

```js
var age = 23
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Variables

```js
var x
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Text strings

```js
var x = "Hacker"
```

```js
var sum = 1+9
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ True/False (Boolean)

```js
var x = true

6Ô∏è‚É£ Constant Values

```js
const x = 420
```

7Ô∏è‚É£ Objects

```js

```

## Variables

The most common variable. Can be reassigned but can only be accessed inside a function.
Variables defined with var move to top when code is executed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ const

Cannot be reassigned and are not accessible before they appear within the code.

3Ô∏è‚É£ let

Similar to const but let variable can be re-assigned but not re-declared.

\* - Multiplication\
** - Exponentiation (ES2016)\
/ - Division\
% - Modulus (Division Remainder)\
++ - Increment\
(--) - Decrement

!= - not equal\
!== - not equal value or not equal type\
\> - greater than\
< - less than\
\>= - greater than or equal to\
<= - less than or equal to\
? - ternary operator

4Ô∏è‚É£ Bitwise Operators

& - AND\
| - OR\
~ - NOT\
^ - XOR\
<< - left shift\
\>\> - right shift	
\>\>\> - unsigned right shift

## Arrays

```js
var fruit = ["Apple", "Berries"]
```
1Ô∏è‚É£ concat() - Join several arrays into one

2Ô∏è‚É£ indexof() - Returns the first position at which a given element appears in an array

3Ô∏è‚É£ join() - Combine elements of an array into a single string and return the string

4Ô∏è‚É£ lastindexof() - Gives the last position at which a given element appears in an array

5Ô∏è‚É£ pop() - Removes the last element of an array

6Ô∏è‚É£ push() - Add a new element at the end

7Ô∏è‚É£ reverse() - This method reverses the order of the array elements.

8Ô∏è‚É£ sort() - Sorts the array elements in a specified manner.

9Ô∏è‚É£toString() - Converts the array elements to a string.

üîü valueOf() - returns the relevant Number Object holding the value of the argument passed

## Dates

Date object is used to get the year, month and day. It has methods to get and set day, month, year, hour, minute, and seconds.

```js
getDate() // Returns the date from the date object

getDay() // Returns the day from the date object

getHours() // Returns the hours from the date object

getMinutes() // Returns the minutes from the date object

getSeconds() // Returns the seconds from the date object

getTime() // Returns the time from the date object
```

## Input Device Events

### Mouse Events
Any change in the state of an object is referred to as an Event. With the help of JS, you can handle events, i.e., how any specific HTML tag will work when the user does something.

click
```js
element.addEventListener('click', ()=>{
// Fired when an element is clicked
});
```
oncontextmenu
```js
element.addEventListener('contextmenu', ()=>{
// Fired when an element is right-clicked
});
```
dblclick
```js
element.addEventListener('dblclick', ()=>{
// Fired when an element is double-clicked
});
```
mouseenter
```js
element.addEventListener('mouseenter', ()=>{
// Fired when an element is entered by the mouse arrow
});
```
mouseleave
```js
element.addEventListener('mouseleave', ()=>{
// Fired when an element is exited by the mouse arrow
});
```
mousemove
```js
element.addEventListener('mousemove', ()=>{
// Fired when the mouse is moved inside the element
});
```
### Keyboard Events

keydown
```js
element.addEventListener('keydown', ()=>{
// Fired when the user is pressing a key on the keyboard
});
```
keypress
```js
element.addEventListener('keypress', ()=>{
// Fired when the user presses the key on the keyboard
});
```
keyup
```js
element.addEventListener('keyup', ()=>{
// Fired when the user releases a key on the keyboard
});
```
